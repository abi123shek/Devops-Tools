# Overview
Trivy is an open-source security scanning tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories. It is lightweight and easy to use, making it ideal for developers looking to integrate security into their CI/CD pipelines. Trivy stands out for its fast and accurate scanning capabilities, supporting multiple vulnerability databases, including those for operating systems, programming languages, and container images.

#Key Features:

* Vulnerability Scanning for Containers: Trivy scans container images to detect known vulnerabilities in the operating system packages and application dependencies, such as those listed in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).
* Support for Multiple Sources: Trivy can scan various types of sources, including:
Container Images: Detects vulnerabilities in Docker or container images.
File Systems: Can scan local file systems and directories.
Git Repositories: Scans dependencies within Git repositories.
Fast and Efficient: Trivy operates quickly because it uses a lightweight and minimalistic approach, fetching only necessary metadata to perform scans.
Multi-Layer Vulnerability Detection: It identifies vulnerabilities not just in the operating system but also in application dependencies (e.g., in language-specific libraries such as Python, Ruby, Node.js).
Continuous Integration (CI) Support: It is designed to work seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated security scans to identify vulnerabilities at each stage of development.
Rich Output Formats: Trivy provides several output formats such as JSON, table, and SARIF, which can be integrated with other tools or used for detailed reporting.
How it Works:

Trivy fetches metadata about the container image, including the operating system packages and application dependencies.
It compares the packages and dependencies against its vulnerability database, which is continuously updated.
It then generates a report of detected vulnerabilities, listing the CVE IDs, severity levels, and remediation steps for each issue found.
